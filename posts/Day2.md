Day-2 Practical Machine Learning with ML zoomcamp

Learned about model selection metrics, evaluation techniques and basics of NumPy. 
Dataset split for model evaluation and validation.
- Split the Dataset into three sets 
  - Training Set 60%
  - Validation Set 20%
  - Holdout set (Hidden from model other datasets) 20%
model evaluation can be done in two ways, 
    - we will train the ML model on training dataset and validate the model on validation dataset then, we evaluate the best from set of models with the Holdout set.
    - we will train the ML model on training dataset and validate the model on validation dataset then, combine both training and validation sets train the best model from set of models and evaluate the best model using the holdout set.

NumPy: is a numerical python library written mostly in **C**, it is used to work with large arrays and mathametical operations in python (major usecases for linear algebra).
