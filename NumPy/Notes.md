# Introduction to NumPy

## What is NumPy?

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
 - a powerful N-dimensional array object
 - sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
 - tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
 - useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
 - Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
 - All NumPy wheels distributed on PyPI are BSD licensed. NumPy is sponsored by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity in the United States. NumFOCUS provides NumPy with fiscal, legal, and administrative support to help ensure the health and sustainability of the project. Visit numfocus.org for more information.
 - NumPy is licensed under the BSD license, enabling reuse with few restrictions.
 - NumPy is developed in the open on GitHub, through the consensus of the NumPy Community. NumPy has a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html#contributor-code-of-conduct) to foster a welcoming community.
 - NumPy’s code is hosted on GitHub, developed and maintained by a community of hardworking volunteers. NumPy is available for Python versions >= 3.6. NumPy is licensed under the BSD license, enabling reuse with few restrictions.

## Why is NumPy Fast?

NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently. This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science. This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.
- NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.
